What I had learned in this workshop includes a few things. The first being more of the c++ language and using cin
and cout. I had used printf in the last workshop only because I was comfortable with it but I now know this is
much nicer to work with. The second is de-allocation of memory. The importance of having no memory leaks after 
using pointers is important to not flood the memory with garbage. The steps of new Pointer, delete Pointer, and
nullptr Pointer will definitely be something I need to remeber I can see. Lastly the overloading of functions.
Having two functions with the same name but different parameters is going to be something that will take time for
me to remember is a thing but the implementation seems very straight forward.
